Surge
=====

Surge downloads cryptocurrency price and volume data from public data APIs.  Currently, it downloads from BitcoinAverage and CryptoCoinCharts, but it can easily be extended to include others.

By default, Surge plugs into a PostgreSQL database and writes price/volume data to the database.

Surge
=====

Surge downloads cryptocurrency price and volume data from public data APIs.  Currently, it downloads from BitcoinAverage and CryptoCoinCharts; I'll be adding exchange-specific pipelines as time permits.

Right now, Surge expects to plug into a PostgreSQL database and write price/volume data to the database, but adding compatibility with other databases and/or flat files is definitely on the to-do list.
